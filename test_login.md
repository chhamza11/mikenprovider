# Testing the Fixed Login Flow

## What Was Fixed:

### 1. Main App Navigation (makin.dart)
- Added BlocListener<AuthBloc, AuthState> in the home widget
- Now properly listens to AuthBloc state changes
- Navigates to '/home' when AuthAuthenticated
- Navigates to '/login' when AuthUnauthenticated
- Added '/login' route to routes map

### 2. Splash Screen (splash_page.dart)
- Removed direct navigation to LoginPage
- Now waits for AuthBloc to determine authentication state
- Reduced delay to 2 seconds for better UX

### 3. Auth Repository (auth_repository.dart)
- Added check for existing sessions before creating new ones
- This should resolve the "login prohibited when session active" error
- Returns existing session if user is already authenticated

### 4. Added Debug Logging
- LoginCubit now logs login attempts and results
- AuthBloc logs authentication state changes
- LoginPage logs state transitions

## Testing Steps:

1. **First Time Login:**
   - Open app â†’ SplashScreen shows for 2 seconds
   - AuthBloc checks authentication â†’ finds none â†’ navigates to LoginPage
   - Enter credentials and tap Sign In
   - Watch console for debug logs
   - Should navigate to HomePage on success

2. **Session Conflict Test:**
   - If you get "session active" error, the fix should handle it
   - The app should either use existing session or clear and create new one

3. **Navigation Test:**
   - After successful login, app should automatically navigate to HomePage
   - No more being stuck on LoginPage

## Expected Console Output:
```
ðŸ”„ Attempting login with email: user@example.com
âœ… Login successful, session ID: [session_id]
âœ… LoginPage: Login successful, triggering AuthLoggedIn event
ðŸ”„ AuthBloc: Processing AuthLoggedIn event
âœ… AuthBloc: User authenticated - [username] ([email])
```

## If Still Having Issues:
1. Check console logs for specific error messages
2. Clear app data/restart to remove any cached sessions
3. Verify Appwrite configuration and network connectivity
